    - The project was funded by ...
4. *Any other comments?*
    - The dataset aims to be a living document, updated regularly with new voter registrations, changes in voter information, and election outcomes.

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- Each instance represents an individual voter, including their demographic information, voting history, party affiliation, and other relevant attributes.
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- Approximately 250 million instances, representing the estimated number of eligible voters in the US.
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset is a comprehensive aggregation of all registered voters in the US, compiled from state and local election boards. Efforts were made to ensure representativeness across geographic regions, demographics, and political affiliations.
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- Each instance includes voter ID (anonymized), age, gender, race/ethnicity, party affiliation, voting frequency, and geographical location (state, county, precinct).
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	-  Each instance includes labels such as party affiliation and voting history in past elections.
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- Some instances may lack complete voting history due to variations in record-keeping practices across jurisdictions.
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- Voter instances are linked to electoral events, geographic locations, and demographic groupings.
8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- Not applicable; the dataset is intended for analysis and modeling rather than machine learning training/testing.
9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Minor inconsistencies may exist due to discrepancies in state and local record-keeping.
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- The dataset does not rely on external resources; all information is self-contained.
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The dataset does not include data protected by legal privilege, such as doctor-patient confidentiality or individual's non-public communications.
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- The dataset itself does not contain information that is offensive, insulting, threatening, or likely to cause anxiety. However, the inclusion of political affiliations and voting history may be considered sensitive by some individuals. Users are advised to handle this data responsibly and consider the implications of its use in their analyses.
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- The dataset identifies sub-populations based on available voter registration information, such as age and gender. Sub-populations are also identifiable by geographical location (state, county, precinct), political affiliation, and in some cases, race or ethnicity, depending on the information provided at registration. The distribution of these sub-populations reflects the demographic composition of the electorate and varies by region.
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- While direct identifiers like names and addresses are removed or anonymized, it is theoretically possible, though challenging, to re-identify individuals indirectly by combining the dataset with other publicly available datasets. Measures are taken to mitigate this risk, including data aggregation and limiting access to sensitive or detailed fields.
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The dataset includes data that might be considered sensitive, such as political affiliations, voting history, and in some cases, race or ethnicity. This information is collected as part of standard voter registration processes and is treated with care to ensure compliance with privacy laws and ethical standards. The dataset does not include direct personal identifiers, financial data, health data, biometric or genetic data, forms of government identification like social security numbers, or criminal history.
16. *Any other comments?*
	- Users of this dataset are encouraged to respect the privacy and confidentiality of voter information. Ethical considerations should guide the use of the dataset, especially in analyses that could impact individual voters or groups. Researchers and analysts should also be aware of the legal framework governing the use of voter data in their jurisdiction to ensure compliance.

**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*
	- Data were compiled from publicly available voter registration records, with additional information inferred from census and public demographic datasets.
2. *What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (for example, hardware apparatuses or sensors, manual human curation, software programs, software APIs)? How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?*
	- Automated scripts aggregated data from public sources, with manual verification processes to ensure accuracy and consistency.
3. *If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (for example, deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?*
	- Not applicable; the dataset aims to include all registered voters.
4. *Who was involved in the data collection process (for example, students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (for example, how much were crowdworkers paid)?*
	- The project was conducted by a team of data scientists, political scientists, and legal experts to ensure compliance with data privacy laws.
5. *Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances (for example, recent crawl of old news articles)? If not, please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with the instances was created.*
	- Data compilation began in January 2021 and was completed in December 2021, with ongoing updates.
6. *Were any ethical review processes conducted (for example, by an institutional review board)? If so, please provide a description of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.*
	- The project underwent ethical review by an institutional review board, ensuring compliance with privacy laws and ethical research standards.
7. *Did you collect the data from the individuals in question directly, or obtain it via third parties or other sources (for example, websites)?*
	- Primarily from public voter registration records, with no direct data collection from individuals.
8. *Were the individuals in question notified about the data collection? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how notice was provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language of the notification itself.*
	- In the case of a private company's voter file, individuals might not be directly notified by the company about the collection of their data for this specific dataset. The data could be compiled from various sources, including publicly available information and possibly proprietary data acquired through partnerships or services. The notification would depend on the original source of the data and the policies of the entity collecting it.
9. *Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and use of their data? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how consent was requested and provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language to which the individuals consented.*
	- For a dataset compiled by a private company, the consent process might differ significantly. If the dataset includes data beyond public voter records, such as consumer data or proprietary insights, the company would likely need to obtain consent from individuals for the collection and use of such data, depending on the jurisdiction and applicable privacy laws (like GDPR or CCPA). The specifics of how consent was obtained would be determined by the company's privacy policy and data collection practices.
10. *If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals provided with a mechanism to revoke their consent in the future or for certain uses? If so, please provide a description, as well as a link or other access point to the mechanism (if appropriate).*
	- A private company handling voter and additional consumer data would typically provide a mechanism for individuals to manage their consent and data preferences, in compliance with data protection regulations. This could include options to opt-out, delete personal data, or modify what information is held by the company. The details of this mechanism would be available in the company's privacy policy or through direct communication channels like customer service.
11. *Has an analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its use on data subjects (for example, a data protection impact analysis) been conducted? If so, please provide a description of this analysis, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.*
	- Given the involvement of a private company and the potential for the dataset to include proprietary or sensitive data, conducting a Data Protection Impact Analysis (DPIA) or similar assessment would be more likely and might even be required, depending on the regulatory environment. The outcomes of such an analysis would help in identifying and mitigating risks related to privacy, data protection, and potential harm to individuals. This analysis would be part of the company's internal documentation and might not be publicly accessible, though summaries or findings could be shared with stakeholders or regulatory bodies as required.
12. *Any other comments?*
	- When dealing with a voter file from a private company, additional layers of complexity are introduced due to proprietary data, commercial interests, and possibly enhanced privacy concerns. Users of this dataset must be diligent in understanding the source of the data, the legal and ethical implications of its use, and any limitations or biases that might be present. It's crucial to adhere to strict ethical standards and privacy laws, ensuring that any analysis does not compromise individual privacy or lead to unintended consequences.
